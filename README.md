## Illustration
### EDU Segmentation & Parsing
Here is an example of discourse segmentation and RST tree conversion.

### Construction of Graphs: An Example
The proposed discourse-aware model selects EDUs 1-1, 2-1, 5-2, 20-1, 20-3, 22-1. The right side of the figure illustrates the two discourse graphs we use: (1) Coref(erence) Graph (with the mentions of `Pulitzer prizes' highlighted as examples); and (2) RST Graph (induced by RST discourse trees).

## Prerequisites

The code is based on [`AllenNLP` (v0.9)](https://github.com/allenai/allennlp/tree/052353ed62e3a54fd7b39a660e65fc5dd2f91c7d), The code is developed with `python 3`, `allennlp` and `pytorch>=1.0`. For more requirements, please check `requirements.txt`.

## Preprocessed Dataset \& Model Archive
We maintain the preprocessed CNNDM, pre-trained CNNDM model w. discourse graph and coref graph, and pre-trained NYT model w. discourse graph and coref graph are provided in [https://utexas.box.com/v/DiscoBERT-ACL2020](https://utexas.box.com/v/DiscoBERT-ACL2020).

The split of NYT is provided at `data_preparation/urls_nyt/mapping_{train, valid, test}.txt`.  

## Training
The model framework (training, evaluation, etc.) is based on `AllenNLP` (v0.9).
The usage of most framework related hyper-parameters, like batch size, cuda device, num of samples per epoch, can be referred to AllenNLP document.     

Here are some model related hyper-parameters:

| Hyper-parameter        | Value         | Usage |
| :-------------: |:-------------:| :-----|
| `use_disco`      | bool | Using EDU as the selection unit or not. If not use sentence instead. |
| `trigram_block`      | bool | Using trigram blocking or not. |
| `min_pred_unit` & `max_pred_unit`     | int | The minimal and maximal number of units (either EDUs or sentences) to choose during inference. The typical value for selecting EDUs on CNNDM and NYT is [5,8) and [5,8).|
| `use_disco_graph`      | bool | Using discourse graph for graph encoding. |
| `use_coref`      | bool | Using coreference mention graph for graph encoding. |

Comments:
* The hyper-parameters for BERT encoder is almost same as the configuration from [PreSumm](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm/blob/master/src/train.py).
* Inflating the number of units getting predicted for EDU-based models because EDUs are generally shorter than sentences. 
For CNNDM, we found that picking up 5 EDUs yields the best ROUGE F-1 score where for sentence-based model four sentences are picked.
* We hardcoded some of vector dimension size to be 768 because we use `bert-base-uncased` model. 
* We tried `roberta-base` rather than `bert-base-uncased` as we used in this code repo and paper, but empirically it didn't perform better in our preliminary experiments.   
* The maxium document length is set to be 768 BPEs although we found `max_len=768` doesn't bring significant gain from `max_len=512`.

To train or modify a model, there are several files to start with.
* `model/disco_bert.py` is the model file. There are some unused conditions and hyper-parameters starting with "semantic_red" so you should ignore them.
* `configs/DiscoBERT.jsonnet` is the configuration file which will be read by AllenNLP framework. 
In the pre-trained model section of [https://utexas.box.com/v/DiscoBERT-ACL2020](https://utexas.box.com/v/DiscoBERT-ACL2020), we provided the configuration files for reference. 
Basically we adopted most of the hyper-parameters from [PreSumm](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm/blob/master/src/train.py).

Here is a quick reference about our model performance based on `bert-base-uncased`.

CNNDM:
| Model        |  R1/R2/RL |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| DiscoBERT      | 43.38/20.44/40.21 |
| DiscoBERT w. RST and Coref Graphs      | 43.77/20.85/40.67 | 


NYT:
| Model        |  R1/R2/RL |
| :-------------: |:-------------:|
| DiscoBERT      | 49.78/30.30/42.44 |
| DiscoBERT w. RST and Coref Graphs      | 50.00/30.38/42.70 |

## Acknowledgements
* The data preprocessing (dataset handler, oracle creation, etc.) is partially based on [PreSumm](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm) by Yang Liu and Mirella Lapata.
* Data preprocessing (tokenization, sentence split, coreference resolution etc.) used [CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/). 
* RST Discourse Segmentation is generated from [NeuEDUSeg](https://github.com/PKU-TANGENT/NeuralEDUSeg). I slightly modified the code to run with GPU. Please check my modification [here](https://github.com/jiacheng-xu/NeuralEDUSeg).
* RST Discourse Parsing is generated from [DPLP](https://github.com/jiyfeng/DPLP). My customized version is [here](https://github.com/jiacheng-xu/DPLP) featuring batch implementation and remaining file detection. 
Empirically I found that `NeuEDUSeg` provided better segmentation output than `DPLP` so we use `NeuEDUSeg` for segmentation and `DPLP` for parsing.  
* The implementation of the graph module is based on [DGL](https://github.com/dmlc/dgl).
